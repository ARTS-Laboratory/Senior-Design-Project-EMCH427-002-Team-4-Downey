Camera-in-the-loop System for Additive Manufacturing 

Background:
The Adaptive Real-Time Systems Laboratory (ARTS-Lab) at the University of South Carolina is working to develop a system for fault detection in additive manufactured components, particularly those that use metal-based processes.  Optical systems that can detect and quantify the size and location of the melt-pool in real-time are instrumental to this work.

Project Purpose: 
This project will develop and build a camera-in-the-loop system that will include the camera housing, data acquisition system, and real-time computing hardware to compute the size and location of the melt pool. The software to compute the melt pool size will be provided but the project team will be required to implement this on real-time hardware. Key components to be developed include camera housing, data acquisition systems, real-time processing kernels, and display systems.

Project Goals:
•	The development of a Camera-in-the-loop System for Additive Manufacturing. 

Project Deliverables:
•	A fully functional camera-in-the-loop system.
•	A detailed public Github page will be made public and students can show it in their job search.
•	Detailed documentation with a “quick start guide”, source code, and CAD files.
